#Report for Task 1: Data Analysis of Financial News and Stock Market
1. Introduction
This report provides an overview of the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and results derived from a financial news and stock market dataset. Various analyses were conducted, focusing on headline statistics, publisher activity, publication frequency, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and publisher domain frequency.

2. Libraries and Setup
The following libraries were used to perform the analysis:

pandas for data manipulation.
matplotlib for data visualization.
sys and os for managing file paths dynamically.
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sys
import os
The project directory and script paths were dynamically added to the system path to allow imports from custom modules.

python
Copy code
project_root = r"C:\Users\hp\Desktop\10Academy\Financial-News-and-Stock-Market-Analysis"
scripts_path = os.path.join(project_root, "scripts")
sys.path.append(project_root)
sys.path.append(scripts_path)
3. Data Loading and Cleaning
The raw data was loaded using the load_data function and cleaned with the clean_data function from the custom modules.

python
Copy code
df = load_data('../Data/raw_analyst_rating.csv/raw_analyst_ratings.csv')
df = clean_data(df)
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Mean length: 80.02 characters
Standard Deviation: 56.13 characters
Min length: 12 characters
Max length: 512 characters
python
Copy code
headline_statistics(df)
plot_headline_length_distribution(df)
4.2 Publisher Activity
The number of articles published by each publisher was analyzed. The publisher activity data reveals that certain publishers have published a significantly larger number of articles compared to others.

python
Copy code
publisher_activity(df)
plot_articles_per_publisher(df)

The distribution of articles published per day was examined. The dataset spans from 2011 to 2020, with publication frequency showing peaks in recent years.

python
Copy code
publication_frequency(df)
plot_publication_frequency(df)
visualize_time_series_analysis(df)
4.4 Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis was performed on the headlines, categorizing the sentiment of each article as positive, negative, or neutral. The results revealed that most headlines are classified as neutral.

python
Copy code
sentiment_analysis(df)

python
Copy code
topic_modeling(df)
4.6 Publisher Domain Analysis
The frequency of different publisher domains was analyzed, with benzinga.com being the most frequent domain in the dataset.
